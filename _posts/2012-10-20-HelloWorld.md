#Hello World!

Well, as a convention, I should throw around a pile of thanks here:

* Mr [Hou, Kanshan](http://houkanshan.github.com "Hou, Kanshan"), who did all the setups for this site. Mr Hou, Kanshan is a very talented front-end designer and developer whom you definetely want to say hello to.
 
* Mr [Tao, Zheng](http://ztpala.com), who did the original design. I do know him in reality but he might possibily be connected to Mr Hou.



Trust me. *That is a pile*. A pile that is not measured in the quantity of items, but in the quantity each item receives.

Few months ago, I sent my Personal Statement to one of my old friend, Cathy, to do some review. Cathy is a non-computer guy, and she had no idea about "Hello World" or what so ever, but she is extremly clever to assume that's a term that every computer guy knows. 

Personally, I really love this term.

It is a weak but resilent voice, and the owner of which had just gave the world a timid first glance. Bearing with a big dreams (like having a glimpse inside at the tall business tower of blinding lights that he walked by every time he finished his English lesson late in the night) our little yet-to-be code-warrior takes on his journey alone. Sometimes, he drops one ; and finds 1,000 errors, the other times he has so much trouble figuring out what is wrong with the codes that to him are perfect, all these terrify and stumble him. He thinks of giving up, but everytime he feels like this, he tells himself to hold on for another second, tells himself to think about his dreams, the tall business tower. Eventually, he is able to make it through (Believe me it's not as easy as what it sounds like). One day he meets the code fairy in his dream. The code fairy whispers:
> 
> I am your shadow
>
> I am your rain
>
> I am your longing a little of your pain
>
> I am red
>
> I am blue
>
> I am your angel
>
> I am in you
>
> I am your madness
>
> I am your tears
>
> I am your sadness
>
> I am your fears
>
> I am restless
>
> I am your dreams
>
> I am the moments in between

Our little code-warrior soon knows he falls in love with his codes. And it's not about those glowing business towers. He also realizes when he loves something so deeply, it becomes his life. Then he suddenly feels like waking up from a long dream that is so blury and tells himself, 

> "I dream to code and I live to code". 
 

Maybe this is a story for every programmer, not just for me.

This is a new "Hello World" for me. It is another timid attempt, yet it is filled with hope and faith, because
